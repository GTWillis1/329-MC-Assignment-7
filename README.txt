I implemented the hourly forecast in a separate table view using the "hourly" element returned by the query. I chose to display the following hourly weather data items:
1) Temperature (°C/°F)
2) Rain chance (%)
3) Cloud cover (%)
4) Humidity (%)
5) Wind (kmph/mpg N (°))
6) Weather icon
Each hourly weather element is in its own section, where the section header is the time corresponding to the data.
